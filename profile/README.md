# Real Time Translation Core (RTTCore)

**RTTCore** builds open-source tools for real-time language translation.

We build fast, simple, and effective solutions to help people understand and communicate across languages. Whether you're watching videos, attending meetings, or building your own apps, **RTTCore** makes real-time translation easy and accessible for everyone.

In progress:
